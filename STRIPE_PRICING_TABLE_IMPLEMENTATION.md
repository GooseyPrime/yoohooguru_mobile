# Stripe Pricing Table Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Stripe pricing table in the yoohoo.guru platform.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `frontend/public/index.html` - Added Stripe pricing table script
- `frontend/src/screens/PricingPage.js` - Integrated Stripe pricing table component

### Features Implemented
1. **Stripe Pricing Table Integration**
   - Pricing table ID: `prctbl_1S44QQJF6bibA8neW22850S2`
   - Publishable key: `pk_live_uDtqCIG6cqKBt1QeIrGVHglz`
   - Supports promo codes
   - Monthly recurring billing
   
2. **Graceful Fallback**
   - Loading state detection
   - Fallback message when Stripe script is blocked
   - Existing pricing cards remain as backup

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Styled to match existing theme
   - Properly integrated with current layout

### Usage
The Stripe pricing table appears at the top of the pricing page with the header "Choose Your Plan". If the Stripe script fails to load (e.g., due to ad blockers), users see a helpful message directing them to the manual pricing options below.

### Testing Notes
- In development environments with ad blockers, the Stripe script may be blocked
- The fallback message correctly displays in these scenarios
- In production, the table should load normally unless blocked by client-side filters

### Future Enhancements
- Could replace manual pricing cards entirely once Stripe integration is fully tested
- Consider adding custom styling to better match the platform theme
- Implement webhook handlers for subscription events (already partially implemented in backend)
